								Fractures are substantial contributors to solute transport sedimentary systems that form pathways. The pathway formed in a fracture has two physical parameters, there are mean aperture and surface roughness. Mean aperture is the thickness of the pathway that the fluid will pass through, and surface roughness is the roughness of the fracture pathway. The two physical parameters of the fracture are important to determine since they affect the permeability value in petroleum reservoir analysis. We developed a machine learning algorithm based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict those two parameters. Furthermore, image processing analysis is performed to generate the datasets. The results show that the CNN algorithm shows good agreement with the reference results. In addition, the algorithms showed efficient performance in terms of computational time. CNN is a type of deep neural designed to perform analysis on multi-channel images that can classify fracture geometry. The best model was determined using a benchmark dataset with a CNN model provided by Keras. The results of experiments conducted on fracture geometry images show that the machine learning model created is able to predict the mean aperture and surface roughness values.

								Several numerical simulations of fluid flow were performed using the Lattice Boltzmann method and image processing techniques to estimate the effective properties of 2-D porous rocks. The effective properties evaluated were the physical characteristics that allow fluid flow including the effective porosity, permeability, tortuosity, and average throat size to determine the storage and transport of fluids in porous rocks. The permeability was compared using the Darcy model simulation and the empirical Kozeny–Carman Equation. The results showed that the Lattice Boltzmann method and image processing techniques can estimate the effective parameters of porous rocks. Furthermore, there was a good correlation between permeability and parameters such as effective porosity, tortuosity, and average throat size. The Darcy model simulation revealed a gamma distribution in the permeability, while the empirical Kozeny–Carman Equation showed a log-normal distribution.

								This research focused on estimating the physical parameters of porous rocks crucial in hydrocarbon exploration using deep learning algorithms. Laboratory measurements have limitations such as time, cost, and core sample limitations, so digital rock models have emerged as a powerful alternative. Digital rock technology involves creating high-resolution images of rock samples using techniques such as micro-CT scanning for the detailed analysis of rock structures and calculation of physical parameters through image processing and numerical simulations. In this work, the CNN architectures included custom-developed models, and transfer learning was applied using pre-trained models DenseNet201, ResNet152, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and Xception to estimate physical parameters such as permeability, absolute porosity, effective porosity, tortuosity, and average grain size. Both CNN A and CNN B were good models for estimating permeability with CNN B being the best model for estimating tortuosity, Xception the best model for estimating absolute porosity and effective porosity, and DenseNet201 the best model for estimating average grain size. These results underscore the potential of deep learning in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of physical parameter estimation in digital rock analysis.

								<p class="full-text" style="display: none;">
								Hydrocarbon production in the reservoir depends on fluid flow through its porous media, such as fractures and their physical parameters, which affect the analysis of the reservoir’s physical properties. The fracture’s physical parameters can be measured conventionally by laboratory analysis or using numerical approaches such as simulations with the Lattice Boltzmann method. However, these methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive; therefore, this research explores the application of machine learning as an alternative method to predict the physical parameters of fractures such as permeability, surface roughness, and mean aperture. Synthetic three-dimensional digital fracture data that resemble real rock fractures were used to train the machine learning models. These included two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed and implemented in this research—which are referred to as CNN-1 and CNN-2—as well as three pre-trained models—including DenseNet201, VGG16, and Xception. The models were then evaluated using the R2 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). CNN-2 was the best model for accurately predicting the three fracture physical parameters but experienced a drop in performance when tested on real rock fractures.
